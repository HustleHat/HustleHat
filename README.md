Hey there — I'm Chris, but around these parts folks know me as **Hustle Hat**.

Aspiring Frontier Systems Engineer, game builder, and digital strategist with a knack for turning **blank screens into living, breathing experiences**.

My core focus lies at the intersection of Human–Machine Systems, Decentralized Intelligence, and Quantum Game Sim.

> Think *Tony Stark meets Rick Rubin with a touch of Johnny Depp energy* — technical, visionary, and just the right amount of organized chaos. ;)
