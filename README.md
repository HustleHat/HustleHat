**Technologist • Worldbuilder • Code Cowboy**

> “Be brave. Be weird. Build dope sh*t.”

Hey there — I'm Chris, but around these parts folks know me as **Hustle Hat**.

Aspiring Frontier Systems Engineer, game builder, and digital strategist with a knack for turning **blank screens into living, breathing experiences**.

My core focus lies at the intersection of Human–Machine Systems, Decentralized Intelligence, and Quantum Game Sim.

Currently working on Posse Studios and writing *“The Rise of Cognitive Frontiers: How Human–AI Interaction, Decentralized Intelligence, and Synthetic Worlds Will Reshape Reality.”*

> Think *Tony Stark meets Rick Rubin with a touch of Johnny Depp energy* — technical, visionary, and just the right amount of organized chaos. ;)
